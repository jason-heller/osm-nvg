# OSM-NVG
A simple LWJGL3-based solution for rendering OpenStreetMap queries in NanoVG. It can be incorperated into your already existing OpenGL projects with lean architecture. Maps can be loaded asynchronously, or blocking if preferred.

Please note not all OpenStreetMap elements are implemented yet. Some map features may not render, or may render with a fallback.
